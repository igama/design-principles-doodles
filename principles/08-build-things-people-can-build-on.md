If the internet has taught us anything, it’s that you’ll never be able to guess all the uses people have of the things you release. We need to design for that, even if we can’t control it. 

A service doesn’t begin and end at our website. It might start with a search engine, or some third party software, and end at the post office. We’re making things that directly affect the lives of millions of people. We should make sure we build them in a way that means they can be improved, whether it’s by us or people interested in the services and information we’ve released.
