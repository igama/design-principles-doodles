We should share what we’re doing whenever we can. With colleagues, with users, with the world. Share code, share designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures. The more eyes there are on a service the better it gets — howlers are spotted, better alternatives are pointed out, the bar is raised.

Anyone who’s interested should be able to find out:

- What we’re building
- How we’re building it
- Who’s doing it
- How it’s going

We should also remember that much of what we’re doing is only possible because of open source code and the generosity of the web design community. We should pay that back.

Being open makes for better services — better understood and better scrutinised. If we give away our code, we’ll be repaid in better code. That’s why we’re giving away all this...
