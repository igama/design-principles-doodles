Multidisciplinary teams are the only way we’ll build services that meet user needs – getting people in the same room, sharing responsibility for every aspect of a service’s performance. 

Development, design, research, policy, project and service management and communications should never be treated as silos. The right combination of people working together and sharing ideas can make brilliant, world-class services. A team will change with the project as it evolves, and that’s okay.
