Government should only do what only government can do. If someone else is doing it — link to it. If we can provide resources (like APIs) that will help other people build things — do that. We should concentrate on the irreducible core.

We’ll make better services by focusing resources where they’ll do the most good - and by not letting the optional and the ‘nice to have’ crowd out the essential.
