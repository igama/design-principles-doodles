The best way to build good services is to start small and iterate wildly. Release Minimum Viable Products early, test them with actual users, move from Alpha to Beta to Live adding features, deleting things that don’t work and making refinements based on feedback.

Iteration reduces risk. It makes big failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons. If a prototype isn’t working, don’t be afraid to scrap it and start again. It also avoids the 200 page spec document which becomes a bottleneck. This, again, is a core advantage of digital. We’re not building bridges. Things can be undone.
