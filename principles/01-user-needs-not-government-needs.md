Design must start with identifying the needs users have of a service. We must understand these thoroughly, researching and analysing data, not just making assumptions. We must have empathy for our users, and should remember that what they ask for isn't always what they need. Then, we must design to meet those needs — not around the way the ‘official process’ is at the moment.

User needs are our organising principle. People come to our sites to get things done and to find information, not just to hang out. Focusing on user needs means we can concentrate on the things that provide most value for money and gives us a clear and useful way to measure our success or otherwise.
